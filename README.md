Wine tasting has been long held in high regard in western society. A professional wine taster, or sommelier, will rate a wine based on a number of perceptual qualities. These perceptual qualities a necessarily related to the underlying chemical makeup of the wine. The goal of this paper is to take information pertaining to the chemical makeup of white wine and predict its human assigned quality rating. The quality rating is an integer in the range 0-10, though there only instances of 7 unique ratings in the dataset. For the purposes of this paper, this rating will be treated as one of 7 possible classes, and predictions will be made via multi-class classification. The dataset selected for this task was the Wine Quality Dataset from UCI. The Pycaret automatic machine-learning library was used to select, train, and evaluate a machine learning model with which to make the aforementioned predictions. The results show a predictive performance of 55% on unseen data, and 56% on the training data. A strong relationship between alcohol content and quality rating was also identified.
